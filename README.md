# Gesture-Wheel

Mod for [Don't Starve Together](http://store.steampowered.com/app/322330/). Also available on the [Steam Workshop](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=352373173) and the [Klei Forums](http://forums.kleientertainment.com/files/file/980-dst-gesture-wheel/).

Gesture wheel makes emotes a little easier by providing a custom interface for using them.

By default, the hotkey is set to G (but you can configure it in the mod config options). Holding G will bring up the gesture wheel, then moving your mouse in a particular direction will select a gesture. When you release G, your character will do the gesture.

On controllers, pressing in the left stick activates the wheel, and selection is done with the left stick.

# Installation
It's much easier to install this by simply subscribing on the [Steam Workshop page](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=352373173), which will also keep it updated for you. But you can also download this and put it in the game's mods folder.

# Configuration Options
Option | Description
------ | -----------
**Toggle button** | Defaults to _G_, but you can set it to any letter key. Hopefully when mods get proper controls options, this will be nicer to work with.
**Wheel size** | Sets how big the wheel is; defaults to _1_, but can be set from _0.1_ to _2_.
**Center wheel** | Determines whether the wheel comes up around your mouse or the center of the screen. This also moves the mouse to the center of the screen.
**Restore cursor position** | _Relative_, the default setting, moves it back where it was before, adding the extra movement you did for the gesture. _Absolute_ sets it back where it was before without adding the extra movement, and _Off_ doesn't move it back at all. If **Center Wheel** is disabled, this setting doesn't do anything.
**Show picture or text** | You can have it show just the picture, just the text, or both.
**Controller stick** | You can set it to use the left or the right stick to open the wheel.
**Limit to 8** | _Off_ (the default) uses all the emotes, but the wheel is getting pretty crowded (currently at 12 emotes), so _On_ limits the wheel to 8 emotes, which are chosen with the remaining options (Right Emote, Down-Left Emote, and so on).
